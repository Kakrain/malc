# malc - Make a Lambda Calculus

## About

Malc is a guide and specification for implementing an untyped [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) in any programming language that supports [higher-order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function). Contributions that follow the general outline below, as well as clever or more ambitious extensions of it in the spirit of this project, are welcome.

Inspired by the [Make a Lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) project.
